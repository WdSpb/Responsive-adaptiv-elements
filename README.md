# Responsive-adaptiv-elements
adaptiv elements: fonts, margin, padding, top? right, bottom, left, line-height, letter-spacing

These elements are usually of interest to webmasters who are tired of changing the font sizes of indents, line spacing, or, sometimes, the intervals between text characters, depending on the screen width. You no longer need to use media queries for these properties.

To use this in your project, you just need to specify your own:

$min: 320;
$max: 1366;

The file uses SCSS syntax
